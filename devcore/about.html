    <h1>Who is We</h1>
    <p>
        We're a community of developers, ranging in skill from straight of of 61a to that 
        friend you know that worries they won't get into Google. From our full stack academy
        to whiteboarding practice, we're committed to helping each other become better 
        programmers and get internships.
